Are you running "jupyter notebook" in windows cmd and it works but on running the same on git bash(on windows) it doesn't work. This is the solution.

Add Anaconda Scripts path for git-bash to see.
{% highlight bash %}
vim ~/.bashrc
{% endhighlight %}
![Opening vim]({{ "/assets/images/vim.jpg" | absolute_url }})
